          <p>"No coward ever did creative work" - Frank Lloyd Wright</p>
          <p>This quote has stuck with me ever since I first heard it while studying the genius mind of Frank Lloyd Wright. At the time, I was not sure what my true passion was, but I did know that I wanted to be creative and I was willing to take the risks. It has been quite the journey to get to where I am today with many different experiences and discoveries, but I have finally found myself at the beginning steps of passion. I am ready and diving right in to making it an integral part of my life! </p>
          <p>Check back here often to view my ever-changing and ever-growing portfolio to follow along my path of passion discoveries!</p>
