          <p>"No coward ever did creative work".</p>
          <p>I have reminded myself of this quote by Frank Lloyd Wright ever since I graduated high school and made my first giant leap into discovering my true passion. I was not sure what my passion was at that time, but what I did know is that I wanted to be creative and I wanted to take risks. 10 years later, I feel like I have finally discovered my passion in general - computer programming and coding. While I know this is my passion, I am still discovering my passion within a passion of what I truly want to focus on in the vaste world of coding.</p>
          <p>Check back here often to view my ever-changing and ever-growing portfolio to follow along my path of passion discoveries!</p>
